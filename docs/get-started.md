# Get started

Like the NHS.UK Prototype Kit, the rig is built on the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework, and uses [NHS.UK Frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend).

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 20

[Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended if you are working across multiple projects that use different versions of Node.js.

## Downloading the Prototype Rig

- [Download the Prototype Rig (zip)](https://github.com/x-govuk/nhsuk-prototype-rig/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

  This will create a copy of the repository rather than a fork. This means you can start your project will a single commit, rather than the Prototype Rigâ€™s commit history. Learn more about [creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

- In the terminal, clone the Prototype Rig GitHub repository:

  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:x-govuk/nhsuk-prototype-rig.git
  ```

  Unlike using a template, this will include the commit history of the Prototype Rig.

## Installation

1. Open the directory you downloaded the rig to

2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

3. Start the application: `npm start`

4. Go to <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
