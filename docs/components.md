# Components

The rig incorporates [GOV.UK Prototype Components](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/), a selection of common components not currently in the GOV.UK or NHS.UK design systems:

* [Autocomplete](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/autocomplete/)
* [Masthead](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/masthead/)
* [Primary navigation](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/primary-navigation/)
* [Related navigation](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/related-navigation/)
* [Sub navigation](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/sub-navigation/)

While these may already be in use across different services, they should be considered experimental until research has validated their design and their accessibility has been audited.
